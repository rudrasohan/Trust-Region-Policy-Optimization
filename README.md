# Trust-Region-Policy-Optimization

My attepmt at TRPO implementation in pytorch. :)

The implementation is inspired from [UC Berkeley's Deep RL Bootcamp](https://sites.google.com/view/deep-rl-bootcamp/home)'s assignments and the following TRPO implementations by [ikostrikov](https://github.com/ikostrikov/pytorch-trpo) and [mjacar](https://github.com/mjacar/pytorch-trpo).

NOTE: This is a work in progress repo that has not been tested throughly.

### Running Instructions
```python
python main.py
```
All parameters exist in `trpo_agent.py`
